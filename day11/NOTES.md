Notes on Day 11
===============

Programs `solve-11*.py` have an optional command-line argument
indicating the x and y sizes of the input. This defaults to 10, so the
regular input needs no special treatment.

    $ solve-11a.py < input.txt

However, the first test input needs an argument of 5.

    $ solve-11a.py 5 < test1.txt
