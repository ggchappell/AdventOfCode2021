Solutions to Advent of Code 2021
================================

Here are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/),
2021 problem set.

Coding Conventions
------------------

All code is in Python 3. Each solution consists of a single source file.
Nothing is imported other than standard library modules. Code has been
executed using CPython under Linux Mint.

Files
-----

Files for each day are in directory day##. The solution to Part 1 is in
`solve-##a.py`, and part 2 is in `solve-##b.py`. The input for the day
is in `input.txt`. Any test inputs are in `test#.txt`.

Programs are intended to be run from the command line. The input is
taken from the standard input; command-line arguments are usually not
required. For example, in a \*ix shell, run the solution to Day 1, Part
1 as below.

    $ ./solve-01a.py < input.txt

The answer is generally printed as `Answer: ######`.

If there are any deviations from the above, these will be described in a
file `NOTES.md` in the appropriate day directory.

Directory `MISC` contains a Python quick-reference and a skeleton source
file that I used as the basis for each solution.
